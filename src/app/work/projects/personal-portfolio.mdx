// src/resources/ui.config.ts
const style: StyleConfig = {
  brand: "red",  // Changes entire color scheme
  accent: "red", // Complementary accent
  // ... other settings
};
```

All components automatically use theme colors through CSS variables:
```scss
.header {
  background: var(--page-background);
  border: 1px solid var(--neutral-border-strong);
}
```

### 2. Blog System
MDX files with frontmatter for structured content:
```markdown
---
title: "Blog Post Title"
summary: "SEO-optimized summary"
publishedAt: "2025-01-15"
image: "/images/blog/blog-1.jpeg"
tag: "Category"
---

## Content here...
```

Automatic blog list generation from MDX files:
```typescript
// Next.js automatically reads all MDX files
const posts = await getPostList();
```

### 3. Performance Optimization
- **Static Generation**: All pages pre-rendered at build time
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component with lazy loading
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic route-based code splitting
- **Font Optimization**: Next.js font optimization with Geist
- **CSS Optimization**: SCSS modules with tree shaking

### 4. SEO Implementation
```typescript
export const metadata = {
  title: "Shipra Soni - Full Stack Developer",
  description: "Portfolio of Shipra Soni, showcasing...",
  openGraph: {
    title: "Shipra Soni Portfolio",
    description: "...",
    images: ["/og/home.png"],

### Architecture Patterns
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Reusable React components
- **Container-Presenter Pattern**: Separation of logic and presentation
- **Real-time Data Sync**: Firebase listeners for live updates
- **Optimistic UI Updates**: Instant feedback before server confirmation
- **Lazy Loading**: Code splitting for faster initial load
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints

## Key Implementation Highlights

### 1. Real-time Collaboration
Implemented real-time synchronization using Firebase Firestore listeners:
```typescript
// Real-time task updates
useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribe = firestore
    .collection('tasks')
    .where('projectId', '==', projectId)
    .onSnapshot((snapshot) => {
      const tasks = snapshot.docs.map(doc => ({
        id: doc.id,
        ...doc.data()
      }));
      dispatch(updateTasks(tasks));
    });

  return () => unsubscribe();
}, [projectId]);
```

### 2. Drag-and-Drop Kanban
Smooth kanban board with drag-and-drop functionality:
```typescript
const onDragEnd = async (result: DropResult) => {
  const { source, destination, draggableId } = result;

  if (!destination) return;

  // Optimistic UI update
  dispatch(moveTask({
    taskId: draggableId,
    fromStatus: source.droppableId,
    toStatus: destination.droppableId,
    newIndex: destination.index
  }));

  // Server update
  await updateTaskStatus(draggableId, destination.droppableId);
};
```

### 3. Role-Based Access Control
Implemented RBAC for secure access management:
```typescript
const usePermissions = (resource: string, action: string) => {
  const { user } = useAuth();

  const permissions = {
    admin: ['*'],
    team: ['read', 'create', 'update'],
    freelancer: ['read', 'update:own'],
    student: ['read']
  };

  return permissions[user.role]?.includes(action) ||
         permissions[user.role]?.includes('*');
};
```

### 4. Performance Optimization
- **Memoization**: React.memo and useMemo for expensive calculations
- **Virtualization**: React Window for large lists
- **Code Splitting**: Dynamic imports for route-based splitting
- **Image Optimization**: Lazy loading and WebP format
- **Caching**: Service workers for offline functionality

## User Experience Design

Real sales growth does not happen when you stick to the same pitch, the same questions, and the same approach.

It happens when you challenge yourself to do sales differently.

## When Sales Feels Comfortable, You Are Probably Not Growing

For a long time, I stayed in my comfort zone with sales.

I used the same opening lines. I asked the same surface-level questions. I pitched the same services in the same way.

It felt safe. It felt predictable. And honestly, it felt like I was doing my job.

But here is what I realized: **comfort in sales usually means you are repeating what worked once, not discovering what could work better.**

When we stay comfortable in sales, we usually stick to what we already know. We follow the same pitch structure every time, talk to the same type of clients, and avoid the conversations that feel risky or uncertain.

This may keep deals flowing at a steady pace, but it does not create real growth. It does not build deeper trust. And it does not prepare you for the clients who need something more.

## Real Growth in Sales Begins When You Challenge Comfort

At Digidelv, I started seeing sales differently when I stopped playing it safe.

Real growth in sales begins the moment you step outside familiar territory. It starts when you try something new:

### Try New Questions Instead of the Same Old Script

Most salespeople ask the same questions in every conversation because they know how to handle the answers.

But the most valuable insights come from questions you have never asked before:
- "What would make this project a failure in your eyes?"
- "Who on your team is most affected by this problem?"
- "What happens if you do nothing for the next six months?"

These questions feel uncomfortable to ask because they go deeper. But that discomfort is exactly where breakthrough conversations happen.

### Approach Different Types of Clients and Industries

It is easy to stay in your lane - to only pitch to the industries you know, the clients who "get it" right away, the people who already understand your value.

But growth happens when you step into unfamiliar territory. When you talk to clients who challenge your thinking. When you learn to explain your value in new ways.

Every time I have worked with a client outside my usual space, I have learned something that made me better at sales across the board.

### Accept Feedback That Challenges Your Approach

Here is the uncomfortable truth: sometimes your pitch is not landing the way you think it is.

Sometimes clients say no not because they do not need you, but because you have not communicated your value clearly enough.

The salespeople who grow are the ones who ask: **"What could I have done differently?"** even when it stings to hear the answer.

They take feedback. They adjust. They improve.

### Take Smart Risks With Clear Intent

Playing it safe in sales means you never test new strategies, never experiment with pricing, never try a different approach to closing.

But growth requires risk. Not reckless risk - smart, calculated risk with a clear plan.

At Digidelv, some of our best client relationships came from conversations where I tried something different - a new positioning, a bold proposal, a transparent conversation about fit.

Not all of them worked. But the ones that did changed everything.

## Every Meaningful Improvement in Sales Comes From a Decision That Felt Uncomfortable at First

Think about the best sales conversations you have ever had - the ones that led to long-term partnerships, referrals, and real trust.

I am willing to bet those conversations did not come from your standard pitch. They came from moments where you took a risk:
- You asked a harder question
- You challenged the client's thinking
- You said "we might not be the right fit" when others would have pushed harder
- You shared an insight that felt too honest

Those moments felt uncomfortable in real time. But they are the moments that built trust.

## When Sales Stays Comfortable, Growth Stops

Here is what happens when you stay in your comfort zone with sales:
- You keep closing the same types of deals
- You repeat the same conversations
- You avoid the clients who would stretch your skills
- You plateau

You might be busy. You might even be successful. But you are not growing.

And in sales, if you are not growing, you are eventually falling behind - because your competitors are learning, adapting, and getting better.

## But When You Choose Growth, You Choose Change, Learning, and Progress

Growth in sales is not about working harder. It is about working differently.

It is about being willing to:
- Unlearn what used to work but does not anymore
- Try new approaches even when they feel uncertain
- Have the tough conversations that weaker salespeople avoid
- Build trust through honesty, not just charm

Comfort feels safe in the short term, but growth demands courage, consistency, and action.

And here is the thing: **the clients who are worth having are the ones who respect you for challenging them, not for making them comfortable.**

## If You Want Your Sales to Grow, Step Outside What Feels Safe

At Digidelv, we have built our approach around this principle: **real sales happens in the uncomfortable moments.**

It happens when you ask the question no one else is asking. When you challenge the status quo. When you position yourself as a strategic partner, not just a vendor.

Because outside the comfort zone, opportunities are bigger, lessons are stronger, and growth becomes possible.

## The Question I Want to Ask You

Here is what I am curious about:

**What is one thing in your sales approach that you have been avoiding because it feels uncomfortable?**

**Is it asking harder questions? Having honest conversations about fit? Trying a completely different strategy?**

I would love to hear your perspective. Because the moment you step into that discomfort, you are stepping into growth.

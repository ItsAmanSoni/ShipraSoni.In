If your deals feel forced, it is not because you are not trying hard enough.

It is because you might be doing sales the way most people think it should be done - when real sales is something completely different.

## What I Used to Think Sales Was

For a long time, I believed sales meant:

- Talking more than the other person
- Convincing someone to say yes
- Pitching products until something sticks
- Never accepting "no" as an answer
- Constant calling and pushing
- Smiling, shaking hands, and closing deals

That is what I saw. That is what I was told. And honestly, that is what most people still believe sales is.

But here is the thing - **that is not real sales.**

That is pressure disguised as persuasion. And it rarely builds anything that lasts.

## The Moment It Clicked for Me

At Digidelv, I started approaching sales differently - not because I read it in a book, but because I realized something important:

**People do not buy because you talk well. They buy because they feel understood.**

That shifted everything.

I stopped focusing on my pitch and started focusing on their problem. I stopped trying to convince and started trying to understand.

And that is when deals started feeling different - more natural, more aligned, more human.

## What Sales Actually Is

Real sales is not about force. It is about help.

Here is what I have learned sales actually means:

### Understanding the Customer's Pain Points

Before you can solve anything, you have to understand what is broken. Not surface-level pain - the real, underlying challenges that keep someone stuck.

I ask questions like:
- "What have you already tried?"
- "Where is this problem showing up in your day-to-day?"
- "If you could fix one thing tomorrow, what would it be?"

These are not sales questions. These are understanding questions.

### Listening More Than Speaking

This one is hard because we are trained to present, pitch, and perform.

But the best sales conversations I have had were the ones where I listened 70% of the time and talked 30%.

When you listen - really listen - you stop selling what you have and start offering what they need.

### Offering the Right Solution, Not Just a Service

There is a difference between selling a service and solving a problem.

Services are generic. Solutions are specific.

I do not pitch "digital marketing services." I pitch **"a system to bring you qualified leads consistently so you can focus on closing deals, not chasing prospects."**

One is a feature. The other is an outcome.

### Educating Customers So They Can Decide Confidently

Good sales does not manipulate. It educates.

I share insights, frameworks, and honest assessments - even when it means saying **"we might not be the right fit for you right now."**

Because an informed decision is better than a pressured one. Always.

### Building Long-Term Relationships, Not One-Time Deals

I am not interested in closing a deal and disappearing.

I am interested in partnerships that grow over time - where the client sees value, refers others, and comes back because they trust the relationship we built.

That is the difference between a transaction and a partnership.

### Creating Value, Not Pressure

Pressure creates resistance. Value creates pull.

When you focus on delivering value - clarity, insight, strategy - people lean in. They want to work with you because they see you as someone who helps, not someone who pushes.

### Asking the Questions No One Else Asks

Most salespeople ask:
- "What is your budget?"
- "When can we start?"
- "Can I send you a proposal?"

I ask:
- "What does success look like for you six months from now?"
- "What is the cost of not solving this problem?"
- "Who else is affected by this challenge?"

These questions go deeper. They uncover the real stakes. And they position you as a strategic thinker, not a vendor.

## The Three Levels of Sales

Here is how I think about it:

### Bad Sales Pushes Products

This is where most people start. They have something to sell, and they look for anyone to sell it to.

It is loud. It is aggressive. And it burns relationships.

### Good Sales Solves Problems

This is better. You understand the problem and you offer a solution that fits.

You are helpful, not pushy. And people appreciate that.

### Great Sales Builds Trust

This is the level that changes everything.

You are not just solving a problem. You are becoming a trusted advisor - someone the client turns to again and again, not because they need a service, but because they trust your judgment.

At this level, sales is not transactional. It is relational.

## Why This Matters Beyond Business

Here is what I have realized: **sales is not just a job - it is a life skill.**

Whether you are negotiating a partnership, pitching an idea, or even convincing a friend to try a new restaurant, you are using the principles of sales.

And when you approach it the right way - with empathy, clarity, and genuine intent to help - it becomes one of the most valuable skills you can develop.

At Digidelv, we believe sales is about:
- **Solutions**, not services
- **Trust**, not transactions
- **Long-term impact**, not short-term wins

And when done right, it helps both the business and the customer grow.

## The Question I Want to Ask You

Here is what I am curious about:

**What has been your experience with sales - either as a seller or a buyer?**

**Have you ever felt the difference between someone trying to sell you versus someone trying to help you?**

I would love to hear your perspective. Because the more we talk about what real sales looks like, the more we can shift the industry away from pressure and toward partnership.

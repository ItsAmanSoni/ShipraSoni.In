I'm not where I want to be, but I'm proud I started.

There was a time when I waited for the perfect moment.

Progress isn't linear. It's messy. It's inconsistent. And most of the time, it's invisible to everyone but you.

## What I've Learned

- Waiting for perfect is just fear in disguise
- Small steps compound into big changes
- The hardest part is always the beginning
- Consistency beats intensity every time
- Being proud of where you are doesn't mean you've stopped growing

## Let's Talk

Are you proud of yourself for starting?

Even if you're not where you want to be yet — that's okay.

The fact that you started puts you ahead of everyone who's still waiting.

Keep going. Keep showing up. Keep being proud of yourself.

Because starting is already a win.

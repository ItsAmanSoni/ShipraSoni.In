Most people think Business Development means convincing.

I think it means understanding.

This is a thought I keep coming back to, especially after years of working with founders, decision-makers, and businesses at different stages of growth. The distinction might seem subtle, but it changes everything about how you approach business development.

## The Questions That Matter

Before any pitch, before any proposal, I try to answer a few questions for myself:

- **How does this business actually make money?**
- **Where might revenue be quietly leaking?**
- **What outcome would truly move the needle for them?**

These are not questions you ask to sound smart in a meeting. These are questions you ask because you genuinely want to understand the business you are trying to help.

When you shift your focus from "how do I convince them?" to "how do I understand them?", the entire dynamic of the conversation changes.

## A Pattern I've Noticed

Here's what I've observed across countless business development conversations:

**Deals don't move forward when you talk more.**

**They move forward when the other person feels heard.**

It sounds simple, but it is surprisingly rare. Most BD professionals are so focused on their pitch deck, their value proposition, their case studies, that they forget to listen.

Listening is not waiting for your turn to speak. It is actively trying to understand:

- What problem are they really solving?
- What have they already tried?
- What are the constraints they are working within?
- What does success actually look like for them?

When you understand these things deeply, the right solution often becomes obvious - and so does whether you are the right fit.

## What I Try to Sell

I try to sell **clarity**, not features.

I try to sell **outcomes**, not deliverables.

I try to sell **growth**, not services.

### Clarity Over Features

Features are easy to list. Every product has them. But what is hard - and what is valuable - is helping someone see clearly:

- Where they are today
- Where they want to be
- What is actually standing in the way

When you can bring clarity to a messy, ambiguous problem, you become valuable before you have sold anything.

### Outcomes Over Deliverables

Deliverables are outputs. Outcomes are results.

A website redesign is a deliverable. A 40% increase in qualified leads is an outcome.

A new CRM system is a deliverable. A sales team that closes deals 25% faster is an outcome.

Clients buy outcomes. They tolerate deliverables.

### Growth Over Services

At the end of the day, businesses do not want services - they want growth.

They want more revenue, better efficiency, happier customers, stronger teams, clearer operations.

When you position yourself around growth - not around the specific things you deliver - you stop being a vendor and start being a partner.

## The Shift in Approach

So here is how I approach business development:

### Start with the Problem, Not the Pitch

I do not lead with "here's what we do." I lead with "what are you trying to solve?"

The pitch only makes sense after you understand the problem. And sometimes, after you understand the problem, you realize your solution is not the right fit - and that is okay too.

### Ask Better Questions

Instead of:
- "Can I show you our product?"

Ask:
- "What is the biggest challenge you are facing right now?"

Instead of:
- "Here is what we offer"

Ask:
- "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing in your business tomorrow, what would it be?"

Better questions lead to better conversations. Better conversations lead to better outcomes.

### Listen for What Is Not Being Said

Pay attention to:
- The problems they mention casually
- The frustrations they downplay
- The goals they mention but do not emphasize

Often, the most important insights come from what is implied, not what is explicitly stated.

### Prove You Understand Before You Propose

Before I propose a solution, I summarize my understanding:

"So if I'm hearing you correctly, the main challenge is X, which is affecting Y, and the ideal outcome would be Z. Is that right?"

This does two things:
1. It confirms you actually understood
2. It shows the client that you were listening

That moment of validation - when someone says "yes, exactly" - is when trust starts to build.

## Why This Matters

Business development is not about manipulation or slick sales tactics.

It is about helping businesses solve real problems.

And you cannot help solve a problem you do not understand.

When you approach BD as an exercise in understanding, you:
- Build stronger client relationships
- Position yourself as a trusted advisor
- Close deals that are actually a good fit
- Create partnerships that last beyond the initial contract

## The Question I'm Asking You

Here is what I am curious about:

**How do you approach business development or sales?**

**Do you start with the pitch or with the problem?**

I have found that the businesses and professionals who focus on understanding first tend to build better, longer-lasting relationships. They might close fewer deals in the short term, but the deals they close are stronger, more aligned, and more likely to grow over time.

That is just how I think about BD.

What about you?

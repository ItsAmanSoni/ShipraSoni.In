### 2. Iterative Development

Don't ask for everything at once:

**Step 1:** "Create basic component structure"
**Step 2:** "Add state management"
**Step 3:** "Implement API integration"
**Step 4:** "Add error handling"
**Step 5:** "Write unit tests"

### 3. Leverage Context

Share relevant information:
- Error messages
- Console logs
- Related code files
- What you've already tried

### 4. Review and Learn

Don't just accept code blindly:
- Ask Claude to explain changes
- Understand the reasoning
- Learn new patterns
- Build your expertise

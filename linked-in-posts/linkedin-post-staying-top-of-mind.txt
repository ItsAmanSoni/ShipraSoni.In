Business Development Is About Staying Top of Mind

Most people think business development is about
closing deals, pitching services, or sending follow-ups.

But in reality…

"Business development is about staying top of mind."

Because deals don't happen when you are ready.
They happen when your client is ready.

And when that moment comes, only one question matters:
"Who do they think of first?"

That's business development.

Not chasing people.
Not forcing conversations.
Not pushing discounts.

It's about consistent visibility and trust.

You stay top of mind when:

✓ You show up regularly, even when there's no immediate benefit
✓ You share insights instead of sales pitches
✓ You add value without expecting instant returns
✓ You follow up without sounding desperate

Many opportunities are lost not because you weren't capable…
but because you were forgotten.

Clients don't always respond immediately.
They're busy.
They're comparing options.
They're waiting for the right time.

And when that time comes, they reach out to the person who:

✓ Educated them
✓ Helped them
✓ Stayed visible
✓ Felt reliable

That's why posting on LinkedIn matters.
That's why follow-ups matter.
That's why relationships matter.

Business development is a long game.

You may not see results today.
You may not see results this month.

But one day, you'll get a message that starts with:
"I've been following your content for a while…"

And that's when you realize—
the work was always compounding.

Stay visible.
Stay helpful.
Stay consistent.

Because business development isn't about being everywhere.
It's about being remembered.

# LinkedIn Post: I'm Not Where I Want to Be, But I'm Proud I Started

---

I'm not where I want to be.

But I'm proud I started.

---

There was a time when I waited for the perfect moment.

Perfect plan.
Perfect confidence.
Perfect clarity.

But that moment never came.

So I started anyway.

---

With doubts.
With fear.
With more questions than answers.

I started without knowing how it would turn out.

---

Some days feel slow.
Some days feel confusing.
Some days make me question everything.

But then I realise something important:

**Starting changed me.**
**Showing up shaped me.**
**Not quitting built me.**

---

Progress doesn't always look like success.

Sometimes it looks like consistency on hard days.

I may not be where I want to be yet.
But I'm proud I started.

And that's enough for now.

Here's what I've learned:

✓ Waiting for perfect is just fear in disguise
✓ Small steps compound into big changes
✓ The hardest part is always the beginning
✓ Consistency beats intensity every time

---

Are you proud of yourself for starting?

Even if you're not where you want to be yet — that's okay.

The fact that you started puts you ahead of everyone who's still waiting.

# LinkedIn Post: The Hidden Cost of Saying Yes Too Early

---

Saying yes feels productive.

It feels collaborative. It feels like momentum.

But in business, saying yes too early often comes with a hidden cost.

I learned this the hard way.

**Early yeses are usually driven by:**
• Excitement
• Fear of losing an opportunity
• Pressure to move fast
• The illusion of progress

**What they're rarely driven by:**
• Clarity
• Alignment
• Long-term outcomes

**The real cost isn't money. It's:**

Rework. Scope drift. Misaligned expectations. Slow decisions. Quiet frustration on both sides.

By the time these surface, momentum is already fragile.

**What I do instead:**

I delay commitment on purpose - not to slow things down, but to speed the right things up.

Before saying yes, I look for:
✓ Clear ownership of decisions
✓ A defined outcome, not just a task
✓ Mutual understanding of success
✓ Comfort with saying no if things don't align

If these aren't present, I pause.

That pause saves weeks later.

**Here's what's counterintuitive:**

Not rushing agreement actually builds confidence.

People trust those who don't chase.
They trust those who think.

A thoughtful "Let's understand this better first" often carries more weight than an enthusiastic yes.

**Before your next commitment, ask yourself:**

👉 What am I protecting by saying yes right now?
👉 And what might I be risking?

Clarity has a compounding effect.

The deals that start slow often accelerate fast.
The deals that start fast often slow to a crawl.

Good decisions don't rush. They reveal themselves.

I'm not where I want to be , but I'm proud I started

There was a time when I waited for the perfect moment.
Perfect plan 
Perfect confidence
Perfect clarity

But that moment never came.

So I started anyway 

with doubts
With fear
With more questions than answers
I started without knowing how it would turn out .

Some days feel slow.
Some days feel confusing.
Some days make me question everything.

But then I realise something important:
 
Started changed me .
Showing up shaped me.
Not quitting built me .

Progress doesn't always look like success.
Sometimes it look likes consistency on hard days.

I may not be where I want to be yet, 
But I'm proud I started.

And that's enough for now.

👉 Are you proud of yourself for Starting ?

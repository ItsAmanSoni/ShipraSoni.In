1️⃣ Write posts that start with their pain, not your skill

Most portfolios scream: “Here’s what I do.”
Yours should whisper: “I get what you’re struggling with.”

Blog idea

“Why Most Sales Conversations Fail Before the First Call”

Open with:

“If your leads go silent after the first message, it’s not because your product is bad.”

This pulls readers in emotionally. Once they feel seen, they’ll stay.

🎯 Connection hack: End the intro with
👉 “If this has happened to you, keep reading.”

2️⃣ Use “open loops” inside your blogs

Humans hate unfinished thoughts. Use that.

Example:

“One small change in my outreach doubled replies — and it had nothing to do with follow-ups. I’ll explain in a minute.”

This keeps people scrolling.

📌 Add 2–3 open loops per post.

3️⃣ Turn blogs into two-way mirrors

At the end of every blog, don’t say “Thanks for reading.”
Say something that invites response.

Better CTA examples:

“What’s the hardest part of closing deals for you right now?”

“Reply to this post if you want my exact outreach template.”

“DM me the word GROWTH and I’ll share how I approach first calls.”

This converts readers → conversations.

4️⃣ Publish “thinking posts”, not tutorial posts only

People connect more with how you think than what you know.

Blog ideas:

“How I Decide Whether a Lead Is Worth My Time”

“The One Question I Ask Before Accepting Any Client”

“Why I Don’t Pitch on the First Call (and still close)”

These position you as a strategic thinker, not a service provider.

💡 Silent flex energy.

5️⃣ Share small, honest failures

This is underrated and powerful.

Example:

“Last quarter, I chased a client for 3 weeks. Closed nothing. Here’s what I learned.”

People trust humans who admit mistakes more than polished profiles.

Trust = engagement = long-term audience.

6️⃣ Add a “Talk to Me” section in blogs

Literally add a small section:

💬 Let’s Talk

If you’re building something and stuck on growth, sales, or positioning, write to me.
I reply to thoughtful messages.

This makes your portfolio feel alive, not static.

7️⃣ Repurpose every blog into conversations

After publishing:

Post 1 insight on LinkedIn

Ask 1 question in comments

Share the blog link in replies, not main post

DM people who engage:

“Hey, saw your comment — curious, what’s your current challenge?”

Now your blog becomes a networking engine.

8️⃣ Use simple, human language (you already do this well)

Avoid:
❌ Synergy
❌ Leverage pipelines
❌ Value-added solutions

Use:
✅ “Here’s what worked”
✅ “Here’s what didn’t”
✅ “Here’s what I’d do again”

People connect with clarity, not complexity.

9️⃣ Ask your audience to co-create

Once a month:

"I'm writing my next blog. What should I break down — lead gen, pricing, or closing?"

When people vote, they're already emotionally invested.

10️⃣ One golden rule 🧠

If a blog doesn't make the reader think, nod, or reply, it's not done yet.
